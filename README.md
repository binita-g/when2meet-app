Simple When2Meet recreation.

## Select folder
```
cd when2meet-app/quickstart
```

## Install with npm
```
npm i
```

## Run the app using npm start
```
npm start
```

You should now see the app spin up at http://localhost:3000/. Drag and drop across the time slots to see the availabilities change. 

## Troubleshooting
If something does not work, try running ```rm -rf node_modules```, ```npm i```, and ```npm start``` again. 

If something *still* does not work, try installing React schedule selector from scratch:
```
npm i react-schedule-selector
```
